    The access codes contained in the list l are 'lucky triples'.
    'Lucky triples' are defined as a tuple (x, y, z) where x divides y and y
    divides z, and where the indices (xi, yj, zk) satisfy i < j < k, such as

        An integer indicating how many access codes are present in list l
        If no access codes are found, 0 is returned.
