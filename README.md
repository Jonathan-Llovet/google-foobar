# Google Foobar Challenge

This repo contains my solutions and attempted solutions to the [Google foobar challenge](https://foobar.withgoogle.com/), one of Google's recruiting programs.

In foobar, you are presented with several levels of increasingly difficult programming challenges to solve as part of a pre-screening process.

In the higher levels, where I have multiple solutions, the solutions are listed in the order that I developed them. The solution whose name is suffixed with the highest number was the solution that I either submitted, or in the case of the-grandest-staircase-of-them-all, was working on when the challenge ended.
